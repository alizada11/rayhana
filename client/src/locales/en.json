    "story_title": "The Rayhana Story",
    "story_content": "Rayhana is not just a kitchenware brand; it is a bridge between the past and the future. We were born from the deep longing of immigrants for the authentic tastes of home. In a world rapidly moving towards modernity, we are committed to keeping the aroma and flavor of traditional dishes alive in modern kitchens. Every Rayhana product is designed with love and precision to be not just a cooking tool, but a companion for creating sweet memories of family gatherings.",
    "mission_title": "Our Mission",
    "mission_content": "Our mission is to bring the warmth and intimacy of traditional tables back to modern homes. We want to enable every Afghan and Persian-speaking immigrant to experience the true taste of home, wherever they are in the world, by offering world-class quality products with authentic design. We are committed to passing on a part of our rich culture and identity to future generations with every Rayhana pot.",
    "founder_title": "Founder's Story",
    "founder_content": "I have lived in China for over fifteen years and witnessed a challenge that thousands of Afghan and Persian-speaking immigrants faced: the lack of quality kitchenware for cooking traditional dishes. After years of extensive research and market analysis, I gained a deep understanding of this need. That moment was a turning point: I decided not only to identify the problem but to create a comprehensive solution with world-class quality. Thus, Rayhana was born a brand that understands the longing of immigrants and transforms it into reality."
